# Design Philosophies For Unitystation

If a feature is badly coded or hard to maintain, if you can remove it, you can rewrite it.

A department should work even with minimal crew, It may work badly but it can still work,
A good example, would be someone breaking into medical and patching up their crewmate with the equipment in the medical department,

All departments should improve with number of staff on the Department, 
there shouldn't be a scenario where There's two people in a and its fully staffed,
resulting in the extra crew in that department having nothing to do.
